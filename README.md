# Raytracer

Over the course of my Srping semester in 2024, I created a raytracer from scratch in C++. The project had me implemented several different features:
- Reading a text file and outputting a ppm file
- Using forward raytracing, shooting a ray from the light to see if it hit the object, otherwise we would use the objects ambient light for its color.
- Texture mapping, taking different ppm files and mapping them to triangles in an image.
- Reflections
- Refractions(This was not fully completed but is something I would like to come back to one day and complete)
